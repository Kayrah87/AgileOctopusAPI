# AgileOctopusAPI
Welcome to the Agile Octopus API Wrapper.<br>
This may be included in any PHP project and will soon be adapted for Laravel

You may access all of the information you require for this package at [Octopus Energy]('https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer)

***

##Basic Usage
installing Agile Octopus API is as simple as requiring it through composer

`$ composer require kayrah87/agileoctopusapi`

Once it is included in your project you can instantiate the API in your project thusly:

`$api = new kayrah87\AgileOctopusAPI\API($account, $api_key, $tz);`

`$account` is your Octopus account number.<br>
`$api_key` is your Octopus API key.<br>
`$tz` is your Timezone, most usually 'Europe/London' but Octopus is available in other countries now, so might be worth checking.
